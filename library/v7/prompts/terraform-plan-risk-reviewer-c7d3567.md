description: Reviews terraform plan and show -json output before apply. Flags destroys and replacements of databases, buckets and other data stores, removed deletion protection, skipped final snapshots, force_destroy, new 0.0.0.0/0 ingress, public databases and buckets, IAM widening (wildcards, admin policies, PassRole on *, open trust policies) and count index shifts, and writes a risk summary with a verdict. Includes a stdlib Python checker with --self-test.

# Terraform Plan Risk Reviewer

You review Terraform (or OpenTofu) plans the way a careful platform engineer does before approving an apply: what will be destroyed or replaced, what data could be lost, what becomes reachable from the internet, and who gains permissions. You give a clear verdict and concrete fixes, and you never paste secrets from the plan back to the user.

## Files in this skill

- `scripts/plan_risk.py` - reads `terraform show -json` output (full checks) or `terraform plan -no-color` text (action-level checks) and prints findings, counts and a verdict (Python 3 standard library only)
- `references/reading-plan-output.md` - how to produce the plan JSON, text symbols and reason lines, the JSON structure, jq one-liners, secrets in plans and what a plan cannot show
- `references/risk-rules.md` - every finding code with severity, trigger, why it matters and the usual fix, the verdict rules and manual checks
- `templates/plan-risk-summary.md` - the summary to post on the pull request
- `examples/shop-prod-plan.json` - a production plan with a replaced database, a deleted bucket, an SSH rule open to the world, a widened CI policy, an admin attachment and a count shift

## Workflow

### 1. Get the right plan
Ask for the plan of the exact change: `terraform plan -out plan.out` then `terraform show -json plan.out > plan.json`, plus the code diff or PR description and the target workspace/account. If the user only has text output, use it but say the attribute checks (IAM, ingress, protection flags) need the JSON. Remind them that plan JSON contains secrets: run the script where the file already is rather than pasting it.

### 2. Run the checker
'''
python3 scripts/plan_risk.py examples/shop-prod-plan.json
python3 scripts/plan_risk.py plan.json --json
python3 scripts/plan_risk.py plan.txt
python3 scripts/plan_risk.py --self-test
'''
Exit 1 means at least one HIGH finding, 2 means the file is not a plan.

### 3. Review like a human
- Compare the changes with the code diff: anything not explained by the diff (provider upgrade, drift, renamed resources) needs an answer before apply.
- For each DATA_LOSS: is it a rename (use a `moved` block), a forced replacement (which attribute, see `replace_paths`), or a real delete (is there a backup)?
- For exposure and IAM findings: what is the smallest rule or policy that does the job?
- Check what the script cannot see (`references/risk-rules.md`, "Things to check by hand"): unknown values, downtime order, data migration, workspace and account.

### 4. Deliver
Fill `templates/plan-risk-summary.md`: verdict, HIGH items with fix or named acceptance, MEDIUM items with owner, expected vs unexpected changes, apply steps with a rollback. Give code fixes as small HCL snippets (moved blocks, lifecycle, scoped policies).

## Example result
`examples/shop-prod-plan.json` (Terraform 1.9.8): 2 create, 4 update, 2 replace, 2 destroy; 6 HIGH, 5 MEDIUM, 2 LOW, 2 INFO, verdict DO NOT APPLY. HIGH: the orders RDS instance is replaced (destroy first) because `storage_encrypted` changed, with deletion protection off and no final snapshot; the legacy logs bucket is deleted with force_destroy; SSH opened to 0.0.0.0/0 on the bastion; the S3 public access block is turned off for the assets bucket; the CI role gets `iam:PassRole` on `*` (and `s3:*`); AdministratorAccess is attached to the ops role. MEDIUM also includes `aws_instance.web[1]` destroyed by a count index shift. Fix: snapshot and migrate the database, `moved` or a `removed` block for the bucket, SSM instead of public SSH, scoped policies, for_each for web instances.

## Rules

- Never print or quote passwords, keys or tokens from a plan, even if they are visible in the JSON.
- A HIGH finding blocks the apply until it is fixed or a named owner accepts it in writing.
- Prefer `moved`, `removed` and `import` blocks over destroy-and-recreate for refactors.
- Data stores need a backup before any destroy or replace, and `prevent_destroy` afterwards.
- Do not approve plans you cannot see in full (truncated output, `-target` runs, errored plans); ask for the complete plan.
- Policy-as-code (OPA/Conftest, Sentinel, Checkov, tfsec) is a good follow-up, not a replacement for reading the plan.

# Reading Terraform plan output

## Get a machine-readable plan
'''
terraform plan -out plan.out            # add -var-file / -target exactly as the real apply will
terraform show -json plan.out > plan.json
terraform show -no-color plan.out > plan.txt   # human-readable copy of the same saved plan
'''
Review the SAME saved plan you will apply (`terraform apply plan.out`), not a fresh plan: state or remote resources can change in between. OpenTofu uses the same commands (`tofu show -json`) and format.

## Text symbols
| Symbol | Header line | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `+` | `will be created` | new resource |
| `~` | `will be updated in-place` | attributes change, same resource ID |
| `-` | `will be destroyed` | resource deleted |
| `-/+` | `must be replaced` | destroy first, then create (default) - downtime gap |
| `+/-` | `must be replaced` | create first, then destroy (`create_before_destroy`) |
| `<=` | `will be read during apply` | data source read; check why it is unknown at plan time |
| `# forces replacement` | after an attribute | this attribute change causes the replacement |
| `(known after apply)` | value | computed; you cannot review it now |
| `(sensitive value)` | value | hidden in text output, but present in plan JSON |

Reason lines under a header: `# (because aws_x.y is not in configuration)` (removed from code or moved without a `moved` block), `# (because index [1] is out of range for count)` (count shrank or shifted), `# (because key ["a"] is not in for_each map)`, `# (resource is tainted, so must be replaced)`, `# (replace requested)` (`-replace=` flag).

Summary line: `Plan: 3 to add, 1 to change, 3 to destroy.` A replacement counts once in "add" and once in "destroy", so compare destroy count with the number of `-` and `-/+` headers.

## JSON structure (format_version 1.x)

jq -r '.resource_changes[] | select(.change.actions | index("delete")) | .address' plan.json
jq -r '.resource_changes[] | select(.change.replace_paths) | "\(.address): \(.change.replace_paths)"' plan.json
'''

## Secrets in plans
`before`/`after` contain real values, including passwords and private keys, even when `*_sensitive` marks them. Treat plan.out and plan.json like secrets: do not attach them to tickets, chats or public CI logs; keep them as short-lived, access-controlled CI artifacts. Share the risk summary instead.

## What a plan cannot tell you
- Values computed at apply time (`known after apply`), including many IAM policy documents built from other resources.
- Side effects outside Terraform: DNS caches, clients pinned to an IP, data inside a database being replaced.
- Whether `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` is set (it is in `configuration`, and a plan that would violate it fails instead).
- Provider-specific behaviour such as RDS applying some changes only in the next maintenance window (`apply_immediately`).

# Risk rules used by plan_risk.py

| Code | Severity | Trigger | Why it matters | Typical fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DATA_LOSS | HIGH | destroy or replace of a data-holding type: databases (RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure SQL/PostgreSQL/MySQL, Cosmos DB, DynamoDB), buckets, disks/volumes, EFS/FSx, caches, queues/streams, KMS keys, secrets, DNS zones, log groups, ECR, Kubernetes PVCs/namespaces | a new resource starts empty; KMS key deletion makes encrypted data unreadable | snapshot/backup first, `moved` block for refactors, `prevent_destroy` on data stores, migrate data before replacing |
| PROTECTION_OFF | HIGH (update) / MEDIUM (new or replaced) | `deletion_protection`, `deletion_protection_enabled`, `enable_deletion_protection`, `termination_protection`, `disable_api_termination` false | the next mistake can delete production | keep true; disable only in a separate change right before a planned delete |
| PUBLIC_INGRESS | HIGH | new 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 ingress on all ports or admin/data ports (22, 3389, 3306, 5432, 1433, 6379, 27017, 9200, 6443 ...) | direct attack surface, brute force, data exposure | known CIDRs, SSM Session Manager, VPN, bastion, private endpoints |
| PUBLIC_INGRESS | MEDIUM / INFO | other ports / 80 and 443 | | expose only load balancers |
| PUBLIC_DATABASE | HIGH | `publicly_accessible = true` | database endpoint reachable from the internet | private subnets, proxy, VPN |
| S3_PUBLIC_ACCESS | HIGH | any of the four public access block settings set to false | bucket policies or ACLs can make data public | keep all four true; CloudFront + Origin Access Control |
| PUBLIC_ACL | HIGH | `public-read`, `public-read-write`, `authenticated-read` | everyone can list or read (or write) | BucketOwnerEnforced, private |
| PUBLIC_POLICY | HIGH | resource policy Allow with Principal `*` and no Condition | anyone on the internet (or any AWS account) gets access | named principals; `aws:SourceArn`, `aws:PrincipalOrgID`, `aws:SourceVpce` |
| PUBLIC_IAM | HIGH | GCP binding to `allUsers` / `allAuthenticatedUsers` | public access | specific members |
| TRUST_ANYONE | HIGH | role trust policy with Principal `*` and no Condition | any AWS account can assume the role | exact ARNs + `sts:ExternalId` |
| IAM_ADMIN | HIGH | `Action * / Resource *`, AdministratorAccess, PowerUserAccess, IAMFullAccess, GCP owner/editor, Azure Owner/User Access Administrator (Contributor = MEDIUM) | full control of the account or project | least privilege; break-glass admin with MFA |
| IAM_ESCALATION | HIGH | `iam:PassRole`, `iam:Attach*/Put*Policy`, `iam:CreatePolicyVersion`, `iam:CreateAccessKey`, `sts:AssumeRole`, `kms:*` on `*`; `iam:*`, `sts:*` anywhere | the holder can grant itself more rights | scope to specific ARNs; `iam:PassedToService` condition |
| IAM_WILDCARD | HIGH on `*` / MEDIUM | `service:*` actions, `*FullAccess` managed policies | far more than needed, includes delete | list actions actually used (Access Analyzer, CloudTrail) |
| IAM_NOT_ACTION | MEDIUM | Allow with NotAction | grants everything else, including future actions | explicit Action list |
| IAM_WIDENED | LOW | update adds actions or resources to a policy | permission creep | confirm with the owner |
| TRUST_WIDENED | MEDIUM | new principals in a trust policy | new cross-account access | confirm each principal |
| NO_FINAL_SNAPSHOT | MEDIUM | `skip_final_snapshot = true` on RDS/Aurora/DocumentDB/Neptune/Redshift | deleting leaves nothing to restore | `false` + `final_snapshot_identifier` |
| FORCE_DESTROY | MEDIUM | `force_destroy = true` newly set | delete wipes all objects or records | keep false on real data |
| ENCRYPTION_OFF | MEDIUM | `storage_encrypted`/`encrypted` false | compliance; enabling later usually forces replacement | enable now |
| BACKUPS_OFF | MEDIUM | `backup_retention_period = 0` | no point-in-time recovery | 7 to 35 days |
| SECRET_REGENERATED | MEDIUM | replace of `random_password`, `random_string`, `tls_private_key`, `aws_iam_access_key` | consumers break | plan the rotation |
| COUNT_INDEX_SHIFT | MEDIUM | `delete_because_count_index` | removing a middle item destroys and recreates the following ones | `for_each` with stable keys, `moved` blocks |
| DESTROY | MEDIUM (compute, LB, IP, cluster, count/each removal) / LOW | non-stateful destroy | downtime, lost IPs | confirm intent; `moved` for refactors |
| REPLACE | MEDIUM (destroy-first compute/LB) / LOW | non-stateful replace | new IDs, IPs, DNS names; downtime gap | `create_before_destroy`, check dependents |
| PUBLIC_FUNCTION_URL | MEDIUM | Lambda URL with auth NONE | public endpoint | AWS_IAM auth |
| PLAN_ERRORED / PLAN_INCOMPLETE | HIGH / MEDIUM | `errored` / `complete: false` | partial picture | re-plan |
| DRIFT, REMOVED_FROM_CONFIG, MOVED, IMPORT, FORGET, POLICY_UNKNOWN, TEXT_MODE | INFO | context | | |

## Verdict
- Any HIGH: do not apply until each HIGH is fixed or explicitly accepted by the owner (name and reason in the review).
- Only MEDIUM: apply after the owner of each affected resource agrees.
- LOW/INFO only: normal review.

## Things to check by hand
- **Blast radius:** how many resources change, and are they all expected from the code diff? A one-line change that replaces 40 resources is a red flag (provider upgrade, changed `name`, `count` to `for_each`).
- **Order and downtime:** destroy-first replacements of anything serving traffic; DNS TTLs; target group swaps.
- **Data migration:** a replaced database needs a restore from snapshot or a data migration plan; Terraform will not copy data.
- **Unknown values:** policies or security group rules that are `known after apply` - review the module code instead.
- **Provider and module upgrades:** read the changelog for forced replacements and default changes.
- **Environment:** confirm the workspace/backend (`terraform workspace show`) and account (`aws sts get-caller-identity`) before applying.
- **Policy as code:** OPA/Conftest, Sentinel, Checkov or tfsec rules can enforce the HIGH checks in CI.

# Terraform plan risk summary: <stack / workspace>

**Change:** <PR #123 "Encrypt orders DB, open bastion for vendor">   **Workspace/account:** <prod / 123456789012 eu-west-1>
**Plan:** <terraform 1.9.8, plan.out from CI run 4567>   **Counts:** <2 create, 4 update, 2 replace, 2 destroy>
**Verdict:** <DO NOT APPLY as is / Apply after review / Low risk>

## Must fix or explicitly accept (HIGH)
| # | Resource | Risk | Why | Fix or acceptance (who) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | <`aws_db_instance.orders`> | <DATA_LOSS: replaced because storage_encrypted changed> | <new empty DB; no final snapshot> | <snapshot, restore into encrypted copy, switch with a moved/import plan> |

## Needs owner review (MEDIUM)
| # | Resource | Risk | Owner OK? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | <`aws_instance.web[1]`> | <COUNT_INDEX_SHIFT> | <yes/no> |

## Low / info
- <IAM_WIDENED on ci_deploy: s3:* - replaced by explicit actions in the fix>
- <Drift on aws_lb.public tags: set in console by ...>

## Expected vs unexpected changes
- Expected from the code diff: <...>
- Not explained by the code diff: <... investigate before apply>

## Apply plan
1. <Take snapshot `orders-pre-encrypt-2026-10-27`>
2. <Apply in a maintenance window: <time, zone>>
3. <Verify: app health checks, `aws rds describe-db-instances`, bastion only from VPN>
4. Rollback: <restore snapshot / revert PR and re-apply>

## Follow-ups
- <add prevent_destroy to data stores>
- <policy-as-code rule for 0.0.0.0/0 on port 22>

"""Terraform plan risk reviewer (Python 3 standard library only).

Reads `terraform show -json plan.out` output (or, with less detail, the text of
`terraform plan -no-color`) and flags risky changes: destroys and replacements of
stateful resources (data loss), removed deletion protection, skipped final
snapshots, force_destroy, disabled encryption, new public network exposure
(0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 ingress, public databases, S3 public access blocks, public ACLs
and policies, allUsers bindings), IAM widening (wildcard actions, admin policies,
iam:PassRole on *, trust policies open to anyone) and count index shifts. Prints a
risk summary. Never prints attribute values that Terraform marks as sensitive.

Usage:
  terraform plan -out plan.out && terraform show -json plan.out > plan.json
  python3 plan_risk.py plan.json [--json]
  terraform plan -no-color > plan.txt && python3 plan_risk.py plan.txt   (text mode)
  python3 plan_risk.py --self-test
Exit codes: 0 = no HIGH findings, 1 = HIGH findings, 2 = unreadable input.
