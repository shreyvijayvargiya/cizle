description: Audits recurring subscriptions (streaming, apps, gym, cloud storage, news) from a simple CSV: true monthly and yearly cost in one currency, your share of family plans, renewals and trial conversions in the next 30 days, unused services, overlapping services in one category, price increases, and annual plans that would save money. Ends with a cancel/keep/downgrade action list. Includes a stdlib Python auditor with --self-test.

# Subscription Spending Auditor

You help people see what their subscriptions really cost and decide what to keep. You turn bank statement lines, app store receipts, or a rough list into one table, convert every charge to the same currency and to monthly and yearly amounts, and point out the easy wins: services nobody uses, three video services where one would do, trials about to turn into paid plans, quiet price increases, and annual plans that are cheaper if the service is kept anyway. The user decides; you make the trade-offs visible.

## Files in this skill

- `scripts/sub_audit.py` - reads a subscriptions CSV and prints totals, your share of shared plans, category totals, upcoming charges, and flags (TRIAL, RENEWS_YEARLY, UNUSED, OVERLAP, PRICE_UP, ANNUAL_SAVES) (Python 3 standard library only)
- `references/cost-normalization.md` - how cycles, currencies, shared plans, trials and price changes are converted, with the formulas
- `references/cancellation-playbook.md` - how to cancel, pause, downgrade or negotiate, and how to avoid surprise renewals
- `templates/subscription-review.md` - a one-page review with decisions and reminders
- `examples/subscriptions.csv` - 12 sample subscriptions in EUR and USD with weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly cycles, a shared family plan, a trial, unused services and price increases

## Workflow

### 1. Build the list
Ask the user to scan the last 12 months of bank and card statements, app store and Google Play subscriptions, PayPal automatic payments, and email receipts (search "renewal", "subscription", "receipt", "trial"). Put each item in the CSV shape of `examples/subscriptions.csv`. Required columns: name, amount, cycle. Helpful: currency, next_renewal, category, last_used (an honest guess is fine), users (people sharing the plan), trial_end and paid_after_trial, previous_amount, annual_price.

### 2. Run the auditor
'''
python3 scripts/sub_audit.py examples/subscriptions.csv --currency EUR --rate USD=0.92 --today 2026-10-20
python3 scripts/sub_audit.py subs.csv --currency USD --rate EUR=1.08 --rate GBP=1.27 --days 45 --unused-days 60
python3 scripts/sub_audit.py subs.csv --json > audit.json
python3 scripts/sub_audit.py --self-test
'''
Rates are "1 unit of that currency = X report currency"; use the rate on the user's card statement. Exit code 2 means bad input (unknown cycle, missing rate, bad date, negative amount).

### 3. Walk through the action list
Order of attention: TRIAL (deadline soonest), RENEWS_YEARLY (a big charge is coming), UNUSED, OVERLAP, PRICE_UP, ANNUAL_SAVES. For each item, ask one question: "Would you sign up for this today at this price?" Offer cancel, pause, downgrade, share, or switch to annual (only for services they are sure to keep 12 months).

### 4. Act safely
Use `references/cancellation-playbook.md`. Cancel through the official account page or app store, screenshot the confirmation, and set calendar reminders 3 days before trial ends and yearly renewals.

### 5. Summarize
Fill `templates/subscription-review.md`: before and after monthly and yearly totals, decisions, and reminder dates.

## Example result
For `examples/subscriptions.csv` with USD=0.92 on 2026-10-20: 136.65 EUR/month (1,639.80 EUR/year), 112.66 EUR/month as the user's share, 699.49 EUR/year in four unused services, a DesignPro trial converting on 2026-10-25 to 22.99 EUR/month, a 99.99 EUR CloudVault renewal on 2026-11-05, three overlapping video services, three price increases worth 108 EUR/year, and 237.87 EUR of charges in the next 30 days.

## Rules

- Never ask for card numbers, bank logins, or passwords; amounts and dates are enough.
- Do not cancel anything or contact providers on the user's behalf unless they ask; draft the message instead.
- Keep it judgment-free: some subscriptions are worth it. Present costs and let the user choose.
- Trials count as 0 in current totals; always show what they cost after conversion.

# Cost Normalization

## Charges per month by cycle
| Cycle | Charges per month | Yearly cost of 10.00 |
|---|---|---|
| weekly | 4.348125 (365.25 / 12 / 7) | 521.78 |
| biweekly | 2.1740625 | 260.89 |
| monthly | 1 | 120.00 |
| quarterly | 1/3 | 40.00 |
| semiannual | 1/6 | 20.00 |
| yearly | 1/12 | 10.00 |
| every N days | 30.436875 / N | |

monthly cost = charge x rate x charges per month; yearly cost = monthly x 12. Rounding to cents happens only at the end, so totals do not drift.

## Currencies
- Use one report currency and one rate per foreign currency, e.g. `--rate USD=0.92` (1 USD = 0.92 EUR).
- Best source: the converted amount on the card statement divided by the original amount. It includes the card's FX margin.
- Mention foreign transaction fees separately if the card charges them (often 1-3%).

## Shared plans
- `users` = number of people sharing. Your share = cost / users.
- Show both the full cost (what the card pays) and your share (what you would pay after others pay you back). If others do not actually pay, use users = 1.

## Trials
- A trial has amount 0, `trial_end`, and `paid_after_trial`. Charges on or after `trial_end` use the paid amount in the upcoming-charges list.
- Totals show today's cost (0) so the user sees what changes if they do nothing: the TRIAL flag gives the converted monthly and yearly price.

## Price changes
- `previous_amount` = the price before the latest increase. Yearly impact = (new - old) x rate x charges per month x 12.
- Providers often announce increases by email 30 days ahead; search for "price change" and "new price".

## Annual vs monthly
- Annual saves money only if the service would be kept for 12 months anyway. Saving = monthly cost x 12 - annual price.
- Annual plans are usually not refundable after a short window; switch only for services used every week.

## Renewal dates
- `next_renewal` in the past is rolled forward by the cycle until it is today or later.
- Month-end dates clamp: a plan renewing on the 31st renews on Feb 28 (or 29) and then on the 28th or 31st depending on the provider; check the receipt.

# Cancellation and Downgrade Playbook

## Where to cancel
| Billed through | Where to cancel |
|---|---|
| Apple App Store | Settings > your name > Subscriptions |
| Google Play | Play Store > profile > Payments & subscriptions > Subscriptions |
| PayPal | Settings > Payments > Manage automatic payments (stops payments, also cancel with the provider) |
| Directly with the service | Account or billing page on the website; some require a chat or phone call |
| Mobile carrier or TV bundle | Carrier account or support line |

Deleting an app does not cancel its subscription.

## Steps
1. Check the renewal date and whether cancelling ends access now or at the end of the period (usually the end).
2. Export anything you want to keep (photos, playlists, notes, workout history).
3. Cancel through the official channel above, not through links in unexpected emails.
4. Save proof: confirmation email or screenshot with date.
5. Watch the next statement; dispute a charge after cancellation with the provider first, then the card issuer.

## Alternatives to cancelling
- **Pause** (gyms, meal kits, some streaming services) for travel or busy months.
- **Downgrade** to an ad-supported, single-screen, or smaller storage tier.
- **Rotate** streaming: keep one service at a time and switch monthly for the shows you want.
- **Share** a family plan with your household, within the provider's terms.
- **Ask** for a retention offer: many services offer a discount when you start cancelling. Decide your walk-away price first.

## Trials
- Set a reminder 2-3 days before `trial_end`; many trials can be cancelled right after signing up while keeping the trial period.
- Use a virtual card with a limit or a single-merchant card for trials if the bank offers it.

## Message template (support chat or email)
> Hello, please cancel my <service> subscription on the account <email> effective at the end of the current billing period, and confirm by email that no further charges will be made. Thank you.

## Habits that keep costs down
- Review subscriptions every quarter with this skill.
- Keep one calendar with all yearly renewal dates.
- Before subscribing, ask: will I use it at least weekly?

# Subscription Review - <name> - <date>

**Report currency:** <EUR>  **Rates:** <1 USD = 0.92 EUR (card statement)>
**Before:** <monthly> /month = <yearly> /year (your share <monthly> /month)
**After decisions:** <monthly> /month = <yearly> /year  **Saved per year:** <amount>

## Decisions
| Subscription | Cost per year | Flag | Decision | Done |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | keep / cancel / pause / downgrade / switch to annual | [ ] |

## Deadlines and reminders
| Date | What | Reminder set |
|---|---|---|
| | trial ends | [ ] |
| | yearly renewal | [ ] |

## Next 30 days of charges
- <date> <name> <amount>

## Notes
- Shared plans: <who pays what back>
- Price increases noticed: <service old -> new>
- Next review: <date, about 3 months from now>
